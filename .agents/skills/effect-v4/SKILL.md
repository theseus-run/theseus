# Effect v4

Use this skill for general Effect mechanics and routing. For Theseus product/domain choices, use the Theseus design skill.

## Route To Narrow Skills

Load the narrower skill when the task clearly matches it:

- `effect-services-layers` - Context.Service, service interfaces, Layer construction, dependency graphs, test seams.
- `effect-errors-schema` - typed failures, defects, Cause, Schema decoding/encoding, schema-backed errors, boundary normalization.
- `effect-concurrency-lifecycle` - Fiber, Deferred, Queue, PubSub, Stream, Scope, interruption, background loops, backpressure.
- `effect-observability-time` - Clock, Duration, timeout, retry schedules, logging, tracing spans, metrics, config, redaction.
- `effect-testing-runtime` - Effect.runPromise boundaries, test layers, deterministic services, TestClock/TestContext, runtime verification.

If several apply, load only the ones needed for the change.

## Operating Model

Effect code is explicit about:

- what succeeds
- what can fail
- what services are required
- what resources must be acquired and released
- what runs concurrently and how it is interrupted

Good Effect code keeps these facts in the type signature until a deliberate boundary handles them.

## Workflow

Effect APIs move. Before using an unfamiliar API:

1. Search current repo usage.
2. Resolve the installed `effect` package from the lockfile or package manager layout, then inspect its local type declarations.
3. Prefer patterns already used in `packages/theseus-core` and `packages/theseus-server`.
4. Treat web examples as v3 unless verified against local v4 types.

Useful searches:

```bash
rg "Context.Service|Layer.mergeAll|Layer.provideMerge|Effect.catchTag|Effect.forkDetach" packages
find node_modules -path '*effect*/dist/Effect.d.ts' -o -path '*effect*/dist/Schema.d.ts'
rg "export declare const catch|forkDetach|TaggedErrorClass" node_modules
```

The repo already has `@effect/language-service` configured in root `tsconfig.json`. Trust its diagnostics when Effect types look strange.

## Type Shape

`Effect.Effect<Success, Error, Requirements>` means:

- `Success` - success value
- `Error` - expected typed failure
- `Requirements` - required services/environment

Expected failures belong in the error channel. Defects are bugs, thrown exceptions, rejected promise defects, or violated invariants; handle them only at boundaries.

## Core Constructors

Use the constructor that matches the boundary:

```typescript
Effect.succeed(value)        // pure success value
Effect.fail(error)           // expected typed failure
Effect.sync(() => value)     // sync, non-throwing side effect
Effect.try(() => risky())    // sync code that may throw
Effect.promise(() => p)      // promise that cannot usefully map rejection
Effect.tryPromise({          // promise with rejection normalized to typed failure
  try: () => fetchThing(),
  catch: (cause) => new FetchFailed({ cause }),
})
```

Rules:

- Use `Effect.try` / `Effect.tryPromise` at foreign boundaries.
- Normalize foreign exceptions into typed errors as early as possible.
- Do not wrap already-effectful code in `tryPromise`.
- Do not use `Effect.runPromise` as a composition tool.

## Composition

Prefer `Effect.gen` for sequential business logic and pipe combinators for local transformations.

```typescript
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const user = yield* Users.find(userId)
  const account = yield* Accounts.find(user.accountId)
  yield* Audit.log({ type: "account.viewed", userId })
  return account
})
```

Rules:

- Use `Effect.map` for success-value transformation.
- Use `Effect.flatMap` when the next step returns an Effect.
- Use `Effect.tap` for effectful observation without changing the value.
- Use `Effect.all` for independent effects; set `concurrency` when work is unbounded or expensive.
- Use `Effect.partition` when partial success is a valid outcome.
- Use validation mode on collection operations only when the caller needs all failures, not fail-fast behavior.
- Keep `Effect.gen` blocks linear; extract named effects when nesting grows.
- Use `Effect.fn("Name")` for important service methods or runtime operations where tracing and better diagnostic names matter.

## Pattern Matching

Use `Match` for tagged unions or multi-branch domain logic when chained conditionals obscure exhaustiveness.

```typescript
import { Match } from "effect"

const render = Match.type<Event>().pipe(
  Match.tag("Started", (event) => `started ${event.id}`),
  Match.tag("Done", (event) => `done ${event.id}`),
  Match.exhaustive,
)
```

Rules:

- Prefer `Match.tag` / `Match.tags` for `_tag` unions.
- Prefer exhaustive matching when the input union is closed.
- Keep simple two-branch cases as normal conditionals when that is clearer.

## v4 Translation Table

Common v3 or stale examples need translation:

| Stale pattern | Theseus v4 pattern |
|---|---|
| `Effect.catchAll` | `Effect.catch` |
| `Effect.catchAllDefect` | `Effect.catchDefect` |
| `Context.Tag` for services | `Context.Service<Service, Shape>()("Name")` |
| uncurried `Layer.effect(Tag, effect)` | `Layer.effect(Tag)(effect)` |
| `ServiceMap.Service` | removed; use `Context.Service` |
| `Schema.TaggedError` | `Schema.TaggedErrorClass` for schema-backed failures |
| bare millisecond numbers for time | `Duration.millis`, `Duration.seconds`, or accepted duration strings when verified |
| `throw` in `Effect.gen` | `return yield* Effect.fail(error)` or `return yield* error` for yieldable errors |

Do not cargo-cult `Effect.Service` unless local v4 types and repo patterns support it for the case at hand. This repo currently uses `Context.Service`.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these unless the file is explicitly a process/test/script boundary:

- `Effect.runPromise` or `Effect.runSync` inside services or domain functions.
- `throw` for expected failures inside `Effect.gen`.
- `try/catch` around `yield*` expecting to catch typed Effect failures.
- `console.log` in runtime code.
- direct `process.env` access outside config boundaries.
- `Option.getOrThrow` in runtime code.
- unbounded queues or concurrency without an explicit bounding argument.
- type assertions that erase the error or requirements channel (`as any`, `as never`) instead of fixing the layer/error model.

## Theseus Checks

Before finalizing Effect changes:

- Search for matching local patterns.
- Re-read the involved service/layer/error signatures.
- Check whether the code is at a boundary or inside the domain; choose schemas/errors accordingly.
- Run the narrow package test when behavior changed.
- Run `bun run typecheck` after service, layer, schema, or error-channel changes.
- If an API was inferred from external material, verify it in the locally installed Effect type declarations before committing the pattern.
